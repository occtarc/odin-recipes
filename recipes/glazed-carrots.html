        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Glazed carrots coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a
          versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a
          Sunday ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are
          a definite kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the
          adults as well!
